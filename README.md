# Morphism Hugo Theme

**This theme is currently a work in progress and we do not recommend its use.**

Morphism is a simple blog theme for the static site generator Hugo.
It supports mathematical typesetting and code syntax highlighting.  By
utilizing copious partial templates the theme is largely customizable.

## Tools

Pure.css powers the layout, Mathjax the mathematical typesetting, and
Prism.js the syntax code highlighting.

## Background 

Morphism began as an attempt to heavily customize the excellent 
[Redlounge theme](https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge).
